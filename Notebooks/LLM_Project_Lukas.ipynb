Cars have been around since they became famous in the 1900s, when Henry Ford created and built the first ModelT. Cars have played a major role in our every day lives since then. But now, people are starting to question if limiting car usage would be a good thing. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.\\n\\nIn like matter of this, article, \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,\" by Elizabeth Rosenthal states, how automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle class families from either Shanghai or Chicago tend to make their homes. Experts say how this is a huge impediment to current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. Cars are the main reason for the greenhouse gas emissions because of a lot of people driving them around all the time getting where they need to go. Article, \"Paris bans driving due to smog,\" by Robert Duffer says, how Paris, after days of nearrecord pollution, enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It also says, how on Monday, motorist with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or be fined a 22euro fine 31. The same order would be applied to oddnumbered plates the following day. Cars are the reason for polluting entire cities like Paris. This shows how bad cars can be because, of all the pollution that they can cause to an entire city.\\n\\nLikewise, in the article, \"Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,\" by Andrew Selsky says, how programs that\\'s set to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took the bus to work during a carfree day, leaving streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million. People like the idea of having carfree days because, it allows them to lesson the pollution that cars put out of their exhaust from people driving all the time. The article also tells how parks and sports centers have bustled throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. Having no cars has been good for the country of Columbia because, it has aloud them to repair things that have needed repairs for a long time, traffic jams have gone down, and restaurants and shopping districts have popped up, all due to the fact of having less cars around.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the use of less cars and having carfree days, have had a big impact on the environment of cities because, it is cutting down the air pollution that the cars have majorly polluted, it has aloud countries like Columbia to repair sidewalks, and cut down traffic jams. Limiting the use of cars would be a good thing for America.

The electoral college is a process of electors from all the states that vote for the president and vice president. There are 538 electors, and you need 270 votes of that 538 to be elected. The electoral college is how we have been electing all of the presidents in America, but the president ought to be elected by a majority vote of the people, not by some fascist in a room voting for us.\\n\\nFurthermore, the office of the federal register gladly explains the process of the electoral college and it has some holes. bradford Plumer explains in his article \\\"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why Even The best laid defenses are wrong\\\" says \\\"at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters.\\\" He goes on and exemplifies the fact that the way the votes are cast and counted could be in fact more individually based. Maybe Mr. Plumer is wrong and the electoral college is the best thing for us, but, most people would agree that if we could all vote and have every individual vote counted, we would have a fair election and the true winner would be voted in.\\n\\nPerhaps in \\\"Five Reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president\\\" by Richard A. Posner, an electoral college would be good to have because of run off and big states and so forth. But plainly put, if we could just count voters as people of one nation, not individual states, we could have an efficient running election. For example: say there is 300 million people in America and the president needed 150,000,001 votes to win, then the majority rules factor can be initiated and there will be no run off, no problems with big states, no problem with swing states, and the certainty of outcome of everyone's president will be decided by majority.\\n\\nLast but not least, all of the authors of the articles have great arguments and have concluded as so. \\\"what have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of commerce, and the AFLCIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college!\\\" Bradford Plumer couldnt have summarized it better. If former presidents and other powerful organizations can can agree on abolishing the outdated electoral college then why cant we just get rid of it.\\n\\nFinally, the electoral college is an old and untrustworthy system of lection currently used in the united states. perhaps if we could try the majority rules and have every legal voter counted as an individual, the election process would be more faithful. All in all, with time comes changes, and with chnges comes broad new spectrums of possibilities. But for the time being we should all be proactive in staying in motion with modernization, and every little change counts. Abolishing the electoral college is an innocent and small step in the right direction.\",\n          \"Limiting car usage in cities can bring about several advantages for both the environment and the community. The passages provide insights into innovative initiatives in various cities worldwide, such as Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, and Bogota in Colombia, where restrictions on car usage have been implemented with positive outcomes. One significant advantage of reducing reliance on cars is the significant decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to pollution, with passenger cars alone responsible for a substantial percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By promoting car-free or car-reduced cities, like Vauban, urban planners are aiming to combat climate change by minimizing the environmental impact of transportation.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can lead to improved public health and well-being. The passages highlight how car-free initiatives in cities like Bogota have encouraged alternative modes of transportation such as biking, walking, and public transit. Not only does this reduce pollution, but it also promotes physical activity and a healthier lifestyle among residents. In Bogota, the Day Without Cars event has successfully brought people together to engage in active modes of transportation, creating a sense of community and shared responsibility for the environment. By fostering a culture of sustainable mobility, cities can enhance the overall quality of life for their residents.\\n\\nIn addition to environmental and health benefits, limiting car usage in cities can also lead to enhanced urban planning and infrastructure development. The passages mention how car-free neighborhoods like Vauban prioritize pedestrian-friendly streets, public transportation access, and proximity to essential services. This type of smart planning not only reduces traffic congestion but also creates more compact, accessible, and vibrant urban spaces.

answer abolishing the electoral college! bradford plumer couldnt have summarized it better. if former presidents and other powerful organizations can can agree on abolishing the outdated electoral college then why cant we just get rid of it. finally, the electoral college is an old and untrustworthy system of lection currently used in the united states. perhaps if we could try the majority rules and have every legal voter counted as an individual, the election process would be more faithful. all in all, with time comes changes, and with chnges comes broad new spectrums of possibilities. but for the time being we should all be proactive in staying in motion with modernization, and every little change counts. abolishing the electoral college is an innocent and small step in the right direction.\",\n          \"limiting car usage in cities can bring about several advantages for both the environment and the community. the passages provide insights into innovative initiatives in various cities worldwide, such as vauban in germany, paris in france, and bogota in colombia, where restrictions on car usage have been implemented with positive outcomes. one significant advantage of reducing reliance on cars is the significant decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. cars are a major contributor to pollution, with passenger cars alone responsible for a substantial percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in both europe and the united states. by promoting carfree or carreduced cities, like vauban, urban planners are aiming to combat climate change by minimizing the environmental impact of transportation. furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to improved public health and wellbeing. the passages highlight how carfree initiatives in cities like bogota have encouraged alternative modes of transportation such as biking, walking, and public transit. not only does this reduce pollution, but it also promotes physical activity and a healthier lifestyle among residents. in bogota, the day without cars event has successfully brought people together to engage in active modes of transportation, creating a sense of community and shared responsibility for the environment. by fostering a culture of sustainable mobility, cities can enhance the overall quality of life for their residents. in addition to environmental and health benefits, limiting car usage in cities can also lead to enhanced urban planning and infrastructure development. the passages mention how carfree neighborhoods like vauban prioritize pedestrianfriendly streets, public transportation access, and proximity to essential services. this type of smart planning not only reduces traffic congestion but also creates more compact, accessible, and vibrant urban spaces. by reimagining suburbs and city centers as places designed for people rather than cars, communities can foster social interaction, economic growth, and cultural diversity. in conclusion, the examples provided in the passages demonstrate that transitioning towards carfree cities can have numerous advantages, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting public health, and improving urban planning. by adopting innovative approaches like carfree days, pedestrianfriendly neighborhoods, and enhanced public transportation systems, cities can create more sustainable, livable, and resilient environments for their residents. encouraging alternative modes of transportation and prioritizing community wellbeing over car dependency are crucial steps towards building a greener and healthier future for our cities.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}","type":"dataframe","variable_name":"result_df"},"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-f9e591fa-5229-4c0a-a0f5-720d2a6aef85\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>id</th>\n","      <th>prompt_id</th>\n","      <th>text</th>\n","      <th>generated</th>\n","      <th>cleaned_text</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>0059830c</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Cars.
